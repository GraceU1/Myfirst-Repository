        <p> Hello My name is Grace U and this is my developer story. From a very early age I have always been fascinated with computers.
        <br>In the begining I was intrested in the hardwear of computers and how they functioned. However, in fifth grade I learned what
        <br>computer softwear was, and that became the new part of computers that I was facinated with. My computer teacher at the time
        <br>used the web site <a href="https://code.org/"> code.org</a>, to teach my class the basics of coding. Where you would select directions on the computer and
        <br> they would be executed by an animation on the screen. I did something similar in my middle school STEM class, where my group
        <br> and I programmed directions for a maze into a computer, and the directions were excuted by a <a href="https://tuckerms.dekalb.k12.ga.us/GalleryImages/201610494333349_image.JPG">Lego car robot</a>. Looking back now these 
        <br>actvities are very similar to computer programming, where the raw code is the instructions is what executes the instructions (code).
        <br>Although this is a simplifid version of what computer programming is, I think having this basic understanding will help in
        <br>these early stages of learning how code.</p>
